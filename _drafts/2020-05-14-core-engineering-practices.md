This deck contains a set of ‘sensible default’ practices that ThoughtWorkers apply to deliver high quality, maintainable software.
This is not a rule book or recipe for success. There are contexts where some of the practices do not fit or can not be applied.
As a ThoughtWorker, we expect you to:
Understand these practices, learn how to apply them practically
Champion the use of these practices with our clients, and be ready to teach them to clients and other TWers
If a practice is not in place at your client, understand why it is not and what is in place to achieve the same outcome.

The (Sensible) Default Practices
Trunk-Based Development
Test Driven Development
Pairing and Pair Programming
Build Security In
Fast Automated Build
Automated Deployment Pipeline
Early and Continuous Deployment
Quality and Debt effectively managed
Build for Production
